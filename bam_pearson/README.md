# BAM Pearson
These scripts were mainly used to generate pearson correlation plots in matplotlib by reading in .bam files which are binary versions of a .sam file and more space efficient for sorting and indexing. Both contain identical information about DNA data and its mapping. In my short scripts I tried to be informative of the criteria for input within the comments to assist anyone who needs a similar calculation within lab.
