# H3k79me2
Some python scripts used in sorting genomic data from my project at UTHSCSA (.bam and .sam files)
These are folders of some small helper scripts that assisted me during my time working in the Jin Lab at the University of Texas at San Antonio Health Science Center. The study we conducted was primarily focused on the effects of the histone modification histone 3 (H3) lysine 79 (k27) di-methylated. Our findings have been published in _Genome Medicine_ as "Integrative analysis reveals functional and regulatory roles of H3k79me2 in mediating alternative splicing"
